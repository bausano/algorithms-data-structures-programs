//! This module plays around with concepts from book by Richard J. Trundeau,
//! [Introduction to graph theory][introduction-to-graph-theory]. The book is
//! aimed at people with little experience with pure math. It introduces pure
//! math using graph theory. It is no surprise that topics in this module are to
//! little practical use. I included them for their aesthetics.
